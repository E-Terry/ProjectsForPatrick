# Projects For Patrick

I have a friend named Patrick who sometimes comes to me with cool ideas and I code them here.

Currently I have:
* ReverseChromaKey: A script that takes an image as an input and then finds pixels within a specified distance of a 
specified color and gets rid of any pixels outside of that. Works similar to a Chroma Key but in reverse. Instead of
removing a green screen it would preserve it and keep the stuff in front of it. Can be a bit finicky and doesn't work
all the time and is only useful for very specific use cases but he used it a lot for this project because he insisted
on using MS Paint.
* Kaprekar's Constant: A script to prove some interesting math stuff that you can wikipedia if you want to learn about.
Runs all 4 digit numbers and exports the amount of recursions it takes to a CSV to see if there was any interesting
patterns (Narrator: There were not). Still an interesting concept and it can be fun to see it do its thing if you want.
